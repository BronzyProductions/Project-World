            <a href="#"><h3>uGonna</h3></a>
            <p>Inspired by one of Gary Vaynerchucks many speeches, his speech about
            wasting time, saying that you are <b>gonna</b> do something but don't,
            this made us think if there is any kind of application that could help
            people on the same quest.</p>
